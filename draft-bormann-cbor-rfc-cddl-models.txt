                   CDDL models for some existing RFCs
               draft-bormann-cbor-rfc-cddl-models-latest

Abstract

   A number of CBOR- and JSON-based protocols have been defined before
   CDDL was standardized or widely used.

   This short draft records some CDDL definitions for such protocols,
   which could become part of a library of CDDL definitions available
   for use in CDDL2 processors.  It focuses on CDDL in (almost)
   published IETF RFCs.

2.  CDDL definitions for (almost) published RFCs

   This section is intended to have one subsection for each CDDL data
   model presented for an existing RFC.  As a start, it is fleshed out
   with three such data models.

Internet-Draft     CDDL models for some existing RFCs      February 2025


2.1.  RFC 7071 (Reputation Interchange)

   Appendix H of [RFC8610] contains two CDDL definitions for [RFC7071],
   which are not copied here.  Typically, the compact form would be used
   in applications using the RFC 7071 format; while the extended form
   might be useful to cherry-pick features of RFC 7071 into another
   protocol.

2.2.  RFC 8366 (Voucher Artifact for Bootstrapping Protocols)

   [RFC8366] defines a data model for a "Voucher Artifact", which can be
   represented in CDDL as:

   voucher-artifact = {
     "ietf-voucher:voucher": {
       created-on: yang$date-and-time
       ? (
           expires-on: yang$date-and-time
           ? last-renewal-date: yang$date-and-time
           //
           nonce: json-binary<bytes .size (8..32)>
         )
       assertion: assertion
       serial-number: text
       ? idevid-issuer: json-binary<bytes>
       pinned-domain-cert: json-binary<bytes>
       ? domain-cert-revocation-checks: bool
     }
   }

   assertion = "verified" / "logged" / "proximity"

   yang$date-and-time = text .regexp cat3<"[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T",
                               "[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}([.][0-9]+)?",
                               "(Z|[+-][0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2})">

   cat3<A,B,C> = (A .cat B) .cat C

   json-binary<T> = text .b64c T

                        Figure 1: CDDL for RFC 8366

   The two examples in the RFC can be validated with this little patchup
   script:

2.3.  RFC 9457 (Problem Details for HTTP APIs)

   [RFC9457] defines a simple data model that is reproduced in CDDL
   here:

   problem-object = {
     ? type: preferably-absolute-uri
     ? title: text
     ? status: 100..599
     ? detail: text
     ? instance: preferably-absolute-uri
     * text .feature "problem-object-extension" => any
   }

   ; RECOMMENDED: absolute URI or at least absolute path:
   preferably-absolute-uri = ~uri

                        Figure 2: CDDL for RFC 9457

   Note that Appendix B of [RFC9290] also defines a CBOR-specific data
   model that may be useful for tunneling [RFC7807] or [RFC9457] problem
   details in [RFC9290] Concise Problem Details.

2.4.  RFC 9595 (YANG-SID)

   [RFC9595] defines a data model for a "SID file" in YANG, to be
   transported as a YANG-JSON instance.

   An equivalent CDDL data model is given here:

   sid-file = {
     "ietf-sid-file:sid-file": {
       module-name: yang$yang-identifier
       ? module-revision: revision-identifier
       ? sid-file-version: sid-file-version-identifier
       ? sid-file-status: "unpublished" / "published"
       ? description: text
       ? dependency-revision: [* dependency-revision]
       ? assignment-range: [* assignment-range]
       ? item: [*item]
     }
   }

   rep<RE>=cat3<"(", RE, ")*">
   opt<RE>=cat3<"(", RE, ")?">
   cat3<A,B,C> = (A .cat B) .cat C

   id-re = "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9\\-_.]*"

   yang$yang-identifier = text .regexp id-re
   revision-identifier = text .regexp "[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}"
   sid-file-version-identifier = uint .size 4
   sid = text .decimal (0..0x7fffffffffffffff); uint63 as text string
   plus-id<Prefix> = Prefix .cat id-re
   schema-node-re = cat3<plus-id<"/">, plus-id<":">, ; qualified
                         rep<plus-id<"/"> .cat       ; optionally
                             opt<plus-id<":">> > >     ; qualified
   schema-node-path = text .regexp schema-node-re

   dependency-revision = {
     module-name: yang$yang-identifier
     module-revision: revision-identifier
   }

   assignment-range = {
     entry-point: sid
     size: sid
   }

   item = {
     ? status: "stable" / "unstable" / "obsolete"
     (
       namespace: "module" / "identity" / "feature"
       identifier: yang$yang-identifier
     //
       namespace: "data"
       identifier: schema-node-path
     )
     sid: sid
   }

3.  CDDL definitions derived from IANA registries

   Often, CDDL models need to use numbers that have been registered as
   values in IANA registries.

   This section is intended to have one subsection for each CDDL data
   model presented that is derived from an existing IANA registry.  As a
   start, it is fleshed out with one such data model.

Internet-Draft     CDDL models for some existing RFCs      February 2025


   The intention is that these reference modules are update
   automatically (after each change of the registry or periodically,
   frequent enough.)  Hence, this document can only present a snapshot
   for IANA-derived data models.

   The model(s) presented here clearly are in proof-of-concept stage;
   suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

3.1.  COSE Algorithms Registry

   The IANA registry for COSE Algorithms is part of the IANA cose
   registry group [IANA.cose].

   The following automatically derived model defines some 70 CDDL rules
   that have the name for a COSE algorithm as its rule name and the
   actual algorithm number as its right hand side.  The additional first
   rule is a type choice between all these constants; this could be used
   in places that just have to validate the presence of a COSE algorithm
   number that was registered at the time the model was derived.

   This section does not explore potential filtering of the registry
   entries, e.g., by recommended status (such as leaving out deprecated
   entries) or by capabilities.

   The names given in the COSE algorithms registry are somewhat
   irregular and do not consider their potential use in modeling or
   programming languages; the automatic derivation used here turns
   sequences of one or more spaces and other characters that cannot be
   in CDDL names ([/+] here) into underscores.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.

   However, the use of IANA registries for deriving CDDL (e.g., as in
   Section 3) is an active subject of discussion.

5.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8610], [RFC9165],
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl-more-control], [STD94] and [STD90] apply.  This
   collection of CDDL models is not thought to create new security
   considerations.  Errors in the models could -- if we knew of them,
   we'd fix those errors instead of explaining their security
   consequences in this section.
